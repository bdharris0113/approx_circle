# approx_circle

this program will generate all points within a circle, then
randomly connect said points to one another with lines.  

It will then randomly reconnect two lines, check if this is new
connection has a smaller total distance than the previous connection,
and if so, reconnect it.  Process continues until the orginal circle 
is found.
